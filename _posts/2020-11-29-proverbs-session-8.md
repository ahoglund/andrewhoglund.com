## Living a Life Pleasing to God

How do we, as children of God, live a life pleasing to God?  What are the things we must do, and also avoid, to please him?

Let us first remember that living a life wanting to please God is not the same as seeking to gain his acceptance and love by our works.  We are starting from a understanding that there is nothing we can do to _earn_ his love and salvation.  This is freely given to us by him, and was expressed by his death and ressurection.  Living a life pleasing to God is an expression flowing from gratitude toward our loving heavenly Father.

### Fear of the LORD

> Prov 15:33 The fear of the LORD is the instruction of wisdom,

> Prov 16:6 By steadfast love and faithfulness iniquity is atoned for, and by the fear of the LORD one turns away from evil.

This is our foundation.  The fear of the LORD first starts with the acknowledgement that he exists.  From there we also must admit he is greater than us, being the creator of all things.  He is omnipresent, omniscient, all-loving, powerful, mighty, holy, awesome.  The fear of the Lord is not only being afraid, but also having a reverence for God.  This means that you inwardly acknowledge his presence and power.

As his children, our fear of God doesn't mean that we do things to please God because we are afraid that he will punish us if we don't. Our motivation to please him comes not from a place of being afraid but from a place of love.  Because we know he loves us, having died on the cross for our sins, our motivation is instead coming from a place of gratitude for what he has done.  Yes, we honor and revere God knowing he is a great.  But we also know he is our loving father and seek to please him as a child would want to please their earthly father.

How does the fear of the LORD affect your life and give you wisdom?

### Humility

> ...and humility comes before honor.

> Prov 16:5 Everyone who is arrogant in heart is an abomination to the LORD;
be assured, he will not go unpunished.

The inward knowledge of God's existence and power is the beginning of humility as well.  In order for you to be wise, you must fear God.  In order to properly fear God you must be humble.   We must remember that "God resists the proud, but gives grace to the humble".

The ultimate expression of humilty is total obedience to the Holy Spirit.  This is something that Jesus expressed perfectly in his life on earth.  He was humble, meek, and gentle. He humbled himself by taking the form of a servant.  He was in his very nature God, but didn't consider that when making the decision to condesend himself to our level in love to rescue us from our broken and helpless condition.

Even in his very arrival we see the expression of humility by taking the form of a baby, and subjecting himself to the necessary natural growth that we all must go through.  The bible says that as he grew up we grew in the stature and wisdom of God.  Here is God in the flesh, choosing to put himself in a position of learning and humilty before his own creation.  He did all this to please his Father, for it was his great mission and pleasure to carry out his exact will.  Everything he did was motivated by a great fear of God, and the desire to please him.  He did this by humbly submitting his will and instead seeking only to do the will of his father.

> 2 Chron 7:14 If my people who are called by my name humble themselves, and pray and seek my face and turn from their wicked ways, then I will hear from heaven and will forgive their sin and heal their land.

> Psalm 51:16 For You do not delight in sacrifice, otherwise I would give it; You are not pleased with burnt offering. The sacrifices of God are a broken spirit; A broken and a contrite heart, O God, You will not despise.

The LORD teaches us humilty through his word, showing us examples of it and stressing its importance.  His word will illuminate areas of pride in our heart.  He will teach us humility through our experiences in life.

What are some examples from your life experience that has taught you to be humble?

### Laying down our plans

> 1 The plans of the heart belong to man, but the answer of the tongue is from the LORD. 2  All the ways of a man are pure in his own eyes, but the LORD weighs the spirit.

> 3 Commit your work to the LORD, and your plans will be established.

Rather then making plans for your life and inviting God to bless them, commit everything to him first and then submit yourself to whatever he decides is best.  This is another expression of humility.  Only when you do this will you truly be in the will of God and his plans for you established.  Even as Christians we can often mistakely think we can just live our life according to how we best see fit, and not acknowledge God in all our ways.

Has God ever interrupted your plans for your life? How so?  Did the result of this turn out for good in the long run?  Have you learned from that experience to first consult God before making plans?

### Motives Matter

> 2 All the ways of a man are pure in his own eyes, but the LORD weighs the spirit.

Everything we've discussed up into this point starts with the thoughts and intentions of your heart.  God not only cares about your outward actions, but also your inward motives.  Why is it you do the things you do?  Are you living a life of good works only to try to earn some favor with God or man?

> Romans 8:8 Those who are in the flesh cannot please God.


The problem is that in our own strength we cannot, and do not desire to fear, God much less please him.  And we are helpless to do so.  He knows that we cannot please him if we are in the flesh and doesn't expect us to try.  The right motives can only come from having the Holy Spirit.  In the flesh we cannot please God.  In the Spirit, we can please him because we are humbly submitting our flesh to his Spirit.  From that we can then carry out his will, since it is no longer us that controls the motive but instead it is his Spirit.

Living a life with a desire to please God doesn't mean we aim to earn something from him.  It is only his Spirit and a renewing of the mind by the word of God that can expose our true nature.  Our "light" is darkness in comparison to the light of God.  And it is his word that shines a light on our inward darkness, and the Spirit that empowers us to "will and to work for his good pleasure".  This means we can read his word, be convicted by it, and with humility ask God to grant us the strength in the inward man to change.


> Romans 8:9 You, however, are not in the flesh but in the Spirit, if in fact the Spirit of God dwells in you. Anyone who does not have the Spirit of Christ does not belong to him.

This means that if you have the Spirit of God then you have a hope.  An internal hope that gives you the ability to please God.  This is because you are now living with his Spirit inside of you.  He takes your filthy stinking garments of works and replaces them with a heart of humility and fear towards him.

### A Life of Faith

 > And without faith it is impossible to please him, for whoever would draw near to God must believe that he exists and that he rewards those who seek him.

All of these things lead to a life of faith.  Faith is when we cast all our cares, desires, plan, motives, outcomes in his hands.  God loves nothing more than for us to put him in control, having faith that in his hands we are safe and secure.  He will never leave us, never forsake us.  We may sometimes feel alone and insecure, but that isn't reality.  When we put our trust in him we are never more secure and safe.


### Avoiding Greed

> Better is a little with righteousness than great revenues with injustice.

He says this because we need to understand that it is more important to pursue his wisdom, righteousness, and his kindgom FIRST in our lives.  And everything else will be added to us after that.  We can spin our selves into a frenzy making plans, striving for more wealth and gain, seeking comfort and avoiding trouble.  But all of that is in vain if we've not first commited ourselves to him.  God will resist you until you first submit your heart, mind, and soul to him. After that you will need to commit your ways to him.  This is faith in action, becuase you don't know what he will do.  You've cast yourself on his mercy not knowing what the outcome will be.  But your faith isn't in vain, becuase he is also faithful and just to those who put their trust in him.  This doesn't mean that you will get everything you want.  But that is why he says that its better to have commited your way to him, knowing that you've put yourself in his will.  If that means living with little, it won't matter because you will have peace.

> 16 How much better to get wisdom than gold! To get understanding is to be chosen rather than silver.

And just as importantly, we don't try to use God as a way to get wealth.  In other words, our motive for doing the things God requires cannot be to increase our bank account.  We may be able to exploit certain laws and principles of God built into how the way the world works to gain wealth, but this doesn't please God.  He cares for our motives, and it is better to have less with a righteous heart and mind.

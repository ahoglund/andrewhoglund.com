Summary of 10-13

In Proverbs 10-13 we see a long set of short instructions Solomon gives his son.
These instructions are meant to guide him in life to a place of greater wisdom
and understanding. Some of the themes of the many projects are regarding:

We cannot take the time to look at every single one of these verses. We can
instead take an overview of them, realizing that these are getting into the
weeds of what it means to have wisdom.  These short instructions are what you
can read, memorize, and apply to your life.  As we said last week, just because
you do these things (or avoid foolishness) will it always go right with you.
This is because we live in a broken world.

1. The importance of instruction and discipline
2. Integrity
3. Righteous words and actions (The ability to do the right thing)
4. Prudence/Discrection (The ability to guard your words and actions)
5. Humility
6. Hard work

All of these things may seem normal and obvious as christians living in America
in 2020. But we also must remember that much of what you know as the ideal way
to live comes from a deeply embedded judeo/christian ethic.  Of course, we see
this foundation eroding away year after year.

We see an ever increasing influce of pagan and hedonistic values pervasive in
our culture.  These things have the appearance of wisdom, but they are empty.
There are many practices that have been imported from eastern philosophy and
religeon, from secular humanism.  Even our politics are driven more by how we
feel about a thing rather than our convictions coming from our desire to see
God's will done on earth as it is in heaven. Things that are clearly laid out in
scripture.

And countering the ideal ways in which Solomon instructs his son are the
consequences of foolishness. Most importantly, the end of foolishness is
destruction.

One verse that really stood out to me is verse 12. This verse perplexs me,
because it seems to me that we can easily be deceived into thinking we are
walking in the right path.  Even as Christians.

12 There is a way that seems right to a person, but its end is the way to death.

QUESTION
So how do you know when you are not on the way that _seems_ right, but on the
actual right path?

The way the seems right is based on your own:
  - Feelings
  - Intelligence
  - Ingenuity
  - Reasoning
  - Culture
  - Family
  - Friends
  - Entertainment

I feel the companion verse to this is  Proverbs 3:5-6:

5 Trust in the LORD with all your heart, and lean not on your own understanding;
6 in all your ways acknowledge Him, and He will make your paths straight.

Follow your convictions, not your feelings.  Your feelings will more often than
not fail you.  But your convictions, based on your understanding of the word of
God will lead you in righteous paths. Remembering that it is faith as your
motivating force behind what you do. For it is impossible for you to please God
without faith.  And as we remember from our study of Romans, whatever does not
proceed from faith is sin.

QUESTION
Are there any areas of your life that seem right, but you haven't asked God if
they are leading you to death?

QUESTION
How does your life so far demonstrate that you seek and follow the Lordâ€™s wisdom?

QUESTION
What can you do to more consistently follow His wisdom?


4 Where there are no oxen, the manger is empty,
but an abundant harvest comes through the strength of the ox.

Nobody ever said the Christian life wouldn't be messy.

Only by seeking the wisdom and guidance of God can our paths lead to life.

REMEMBER: Wide is the gate to descruction, and many people find it.  But narrow
is th path of life.  Matt 7:13

## Wisdom given by the Holy Spirit (our experience)

So as we read the word of God, namely these verses in Proverbs we must remember
that it is by the power of the Holy Spirit that we are called to live these
things out.

True Wisdom is given through the Holy Spirit. The ability to carry out the
actions informed by our wisdom and understand comes from the Holy Spirit.  The character and mind of God is
ours through Christ Jesus.  If we lack wisdom, we have a promise from God that
he will give it to us.  True lasting wisdom can only come from the Holy Spirit
working in and through us.

A person who isn't a follwer of God can read Proverbs and decide to follow its
precepts.  Doing so might result in reaping the benefits promised by God.
This is because God's wisdom and rules reign supreme in the universe no matter
who chooses to follow them.  But this doesn't imply that this person has chosen
the true and lasting wisdom of God, which is to put your trust in the work of Christ.

The Holy Spirit is only given to those who have put their trust is Jesus's death
and ressurection.  He is the means by which true and lasting wisdom can be given
to us.  We are able to live life in a pleasing and obedient manner, and are
given power over sin, the flesh, and the devil through Him.

We see this clearly stated in Col 1:9-12

9 For this reason also, since the day we heard of it, we have not ceased to pray for you and to ask that you may be filled with the knowledge of His will in all spiritual wisdom and understanding,
10 so that you will walk in a manner worthy of the Lord, to please Him in all respects, bearing fruit in every good work and increasing in the knowledge of God;
11 strengthened with all power, according to His glorious might, for the attaining of all steadfastness and patience; joyously
12 giving thanks to the Father, who has qualified us to share in the inheritance of the saints in Light.
